* What is a framework? 
* - A framework is a set of tools and libraries that simplify the development process by providing a ready-made structure and code templates for creating applications.


* Differences and advantages of frameworks are differentiated by:
* - Language (e.g. React for JavaScript, Django for Python)
* - Architecture (MVC, MVVM)
* - Functionality (e.g., frontend or backend frameworks)
* Benefits:
* - Accelerate development with out-of-the-box tools and templates
* - Improve code readability and structure
* - Provide support and updates from the community


* Which frameworks to choose and why?
* - For frontend, React is a popular choice because of its flexibility, components, and community support. It is well suited for dynamic single-page applications.
